Testing if I can write to OpeningBuilderForm.cs

The HasBeenWritten flag has already been added to MoveNode in PgnParser.cs.

Now I need to:
1. Add ResetWrittenFlags method to OpeningBuilderForm.cs
2. Call it at the start of GeneratePgn
3. Check the flag before writing moves
4. Set the flag after writing moves

This will prevent double-writing moves in a much simpler way than tracking afterVariations.
